# Data Science Exam
*by Felicia Heilgendorff and Martine Greve*

In this project we built BERT, Naïve Bayes and LSTM models that classify stories either as remembered or imagined. We also built binary classification models that classify texts either as remembered or imagined based on external variables (not the story texts). Additionally, we did topic modeling on our texts.

Data is saved in [hippoCorpusV2.csv](hippoCorpusV2.csv) and was taken from:
