# Data Science Exam
*by Felicia Heilgendorff and Martine Greve*

In this project we built text-based BERT, Na√Øve Bayes, LSTM and SVM models that classify stories either as remembered or imagined. We also built variable-based binary classification models that classify texts either as remembered or imagined based on external variables (not the story texts). Additionally, we performed topic modeling on our texts.

Data is saved in [hippoCorpusV2.csv](hippoCorpusV2.csv) and was taken from:
